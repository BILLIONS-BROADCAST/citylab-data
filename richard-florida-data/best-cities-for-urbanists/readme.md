## Best Cities for Urbanists

The spreadsheet `best_cities_for_urbanists.csv` contains data for Richard Florida's CityLab story, "The Best Places for Urbanists."

The spreadsheet's layout is as follows:

- `msa`: The five-digit U.S. Census identifier for each metropolitan area. Best imported in text format, not numberic.
- `msa_name`: The name of each metropolitan area.
- `percent_change_2014_2019`: The percent change in the number of urban planning jobs, 2014-2019
- `location_quotient_2018`: A ratio of each metro's share of urban planning jobs to the national average. Values less than one indicate fewer urban planners than the national average. The higher a value is above 1, the more urban planners it has relative to the national average.
- `median_annual_earnings`: The median annual earnings for urban planners in each metro.
