## Richard Florida's Metro Car-Free Index

Richard Florida and Charlotta Mellander devised a "Metro Car-Free Index" to measure which U.S. metropolitan areas are best-suited to a car-free lifestyle. Read their introduction to the index, along with graphics, in the CityLab article, ["The Best and Worst U.S. Places to Live Car-Free"](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/09/where-live-no-car-america-public-transit-transportation/598606/).

The index looks at four variables, all from the U.S. Census's most recent five-year estimates:

- the share of households that donâ€™t have access to their own vehicle
- the share of commuters who take transit to work
- the share of commuters who bike to work
- the share of commuters who walk to work

The spreadsheet file [`car-free-index.csv`](https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/blob/master/richard-florida-data/best-cities-for-urbanists/best_cities_for_urbanists.csv) contains data for all 382 U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas, from Carson City, Nevada all the way up to New York, New York. A higher value on the index indicates more people relying on means other than cars to get around.
